<h3> A Free Digital Society</h3>

  <tr>
    <td>Abstract</td>
    <td><p>Activities directed at "including" more people in the use of digital technology are predicated on the assumption that such inclusion is invariably a good thing.  It appears so, when judged solely by immediate practical convenience.  However, if we also judge in terms of human rights, whether digital inclusion is good or bad depends on what kind of digital world we are to be included in.  If we wish to work towards digital inclusion as a goal, it behooves us to make sure it is the good kind.</p></td>
